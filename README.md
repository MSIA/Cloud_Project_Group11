### Project Overview
ChartBuster is here to solve one of the biggest mysteries in the music world: what makes a song popular? No need to ponder over countless variables or base your judgments on gut feelings. Our state-of-the-art prediction model will handle the complexity and offer you predictions in a user-friendly, interactive format.

Powered by Streamlit and deployed on AWS Cloud, ChartBuster harnesses the power of AI to predict song popularity based on user-provided attributes. Leveraging sophisticated ML algorithms and a comprehensive dataset, we have created a tool that goes beyond simple predictionâ€”it delivers insights, empowers decision-making, and uncovers the unseen patterns of song popularity.

Whether you're a budding artist dreaming of topping the charts, a record producer searching for the next big hit, or a music lover who loves predicting trends, ChartBuster is your backstage pass to the future of music. Get ready to step into the spotlight and turn the music industry on its head! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ§

### Installation & Setup

Prerequisites
-------------

Here are a few things you'll need before we start:

1. Python 3.7 or later: Python is our core programming language. If you haven't already installed it, head over to the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/) to download the latest version.
    
2. AWS Account: Since our app is deployed on the AWS cloud under MSIA Account, you'll need an AWS account and corresponding credentials from MSiA. For more infomation to create the accnount, you can refer to: [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/).
    
3. AWS CLI: The AWS Command Line Interface is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. You can download it [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
    
4. Streamlit: This is the engine that powers our app. Don't worry if you haven't used it before, it's easy to install and incredibly user-friendly!

Installation Steps
------------------

Let's get your system ready to run ChartBuster:

1. **Clone the Repository**: ```bash
git clone 
```
    
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: This is an optional step, but it's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your Python projects.
    
3. **Install the Required Packages**: We've made this step easy for you. All the required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. All you need to do is run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and Python will handle the rest!
